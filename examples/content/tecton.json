    {
        "question": "How does Tecton ensure data freshness in predictions?",
        "answer": "Tecton ensures data freshness through its unified serving system, which provides fast, reliable, and scalable access to features needed for inference by supporting both real-time and batch ML applications, ensuring that features can be served at any freshness, throughput, or latency requirement."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the enterprise feature store in Tecton?",
        "answer": "The enterprise feature store in Tecton serves as a centralized repository for managing, sharing, and retrieving features across various data sources and projects, streamlining governance, sharing, and reuse of features, and enhancing model accuracy while preventing feature pipeline sprawl."
